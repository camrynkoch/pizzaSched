We were tasked with creating a shift scheduling tool for the employees at Chianti Brick Oven Trattoria in Chatham, NJ.

Mr. G, the manager of Chianti, was scheduling shifts each week by hand, asking each employee to send their availability
in the form of a text. This way of doing things caused extra stress for Mr. G as well as wasting time each week. We have
created an online tool to allow employees at Chianti to submit their availabilities for the week, see other employee
availabilities, and allow Mr. G the ease of automatically recieving employee availability each week.
